Utilizing my blue magnetic icon gizmo (not to be confused with my blue magnetic web dynamo) I generated these icons for your diverse GUI pleasures. They are NOT OS 8.5 specific, so you can use them comfortably even on your old, dusty Mac.

Want to share these icons with a friend, or put them on your groovy shareware CD? Please do ... but please keep the set intact (i.e. include the READ ME). 

Have a nice day ---> Brian
