October 1998Coffee ShopIcon CollectionIntroduction:This set contains 29 icons of items relating to the ritual of coffee. A friend of mine believes that having coffee, for some, has become a quasi-religious event. For many of us, having coffee separates the work day, where we wear the guise of a studious employee, and the night, where we are ourselves. To ask someone out for coffee rarely means that you really want to drink a caffeinated beverage, but that you have something you want to tell them, that you want to spend time with them, or any number of other hidden meanings that no longer need any other invitation. It's just the drink.I got a little carried away on this set, but please enjoy some of my weirder icons, like the MacOS Bean and the Bean Folders. I had fun!Legality:The enclosed icons are ©1998 PixelPress.
