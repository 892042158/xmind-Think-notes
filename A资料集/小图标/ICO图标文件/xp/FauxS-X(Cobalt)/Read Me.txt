	This Icon Package has bean Re-Packaged and renamed form it's original name
	FauxS-X (A**A) becuse of leagle restrictions by Apple Computer. Nothing else has Changed.
	I Have a updated pack age in the works for the middle of July 2001.	

	All the Icons in this Package are saved in 16bit color with Five(5)
	format sizes. (16x16.32x32,48x48,64x64 & 72x72)
	 
	This is the fifth in a series of at least four(5) Iconpacks that I
	have planned. All of “FauxS-X” Icons will be intended for people who
	like to have large high color Icons.
